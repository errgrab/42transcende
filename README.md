### Full Description of Modules

These are the full description of the modules chosen for this project, as we consider them essential for a complete Marketplace platform experience, especially one focused on a nice market of Graphical Assets and Shaders.

#### Web Major 1

**Major**: Use a framework for both the frontend and backend.
- Use a frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, etc.).
- Use a backend framework (Express, NestJS, Django, Flask, Ruby on Rails,
etc.).
- Full-stack frameworks (Next.js, Nuxt.js, SvelteKit) count as both if you use
both their frontend and backend capabilities.

#### Web Major 2

**Major**: Implement real-time features using WebSockets or similar technology.
- Real-time updates across clients.
- Handle connection/disconnection gracefully.
- Efficient message broadcasting.

#### Web Minor 4

**Minor**: A complete notification system for all creation, update, and deletion ac-
tions.

#### Web Minor 10

**Minor**: File upload and management system.
- Support multiple file types (images, documents, etc.).
- Client-side and server-side validation (type, size, format).
- Secure file storage with proper access control.
- File preview functionality where applicable.
- Progress indicators for uploads.
- Ability to delete uploaded files.

#### User Major 1

**Major**: Standard user management and authentication.
- Users can update their profile information.
- Users can upload an avatar (with a default avatar if none provided).
- Users can add other users as friends and see their online status.
- Users have a profile page displaying their information.

#### User Major 2

**Major**: Advanced permissions system:
- View, edit, and delete users (CRUD).
- Roles management (admin, user, guest, moderator, etc.).
- Different views and actions based on user role.

#### User Minor 2

**Minor**: Implement remote authentication with OAuth 2.0 (Google, GitHub, 42,
etc.).

#### User Minor 4

**Minor**: User activity analytics and insights dashboard.

#### AI Major 4

**Major**: Recommendation system using machine learning.
- Personalized recommendations based on user behavior.
- Collaborative filtering or content-based filtering.
- Continuously improve recommendations over time.

#### AI Minor 1

**Minor**: Content moderation AI (auto moderation, auto deletion, auto warning,
etc.)

#### Gaming Major 5

**Major**: Implement advanced 3D graphics using a library like Three.js or Baby-
lon.js.
- Create an immersive 3D environment.
- Implement advanced rendering techniques.
- Ensure smooth performance and user interaction.

#### DevOps Major 1

**Major**: Infrastructure for log management using ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash,
Kibana).
- Elasticsearch to store and index logs.
- Logstash to collect and transform logs.
- Kibana for visualization and dashboards.

#### DevOps Major 3

**Major**: Backend as microservices.
- Design loosely-coupled services with clear interfaces.
- Use REST APIs or message queues for communication.
- Each service should have a single responsibility.

#### Module of Choice

**Major**: Implement a custom module that is not listed above.
- The module must be substantial and demonstrate technical complexity.
- You must provide proper justification in your README.md explaining:
  - Why you chose this module.
  - What technical challenges it addresses.
  - How it adds value to your project.
  - Why it deserves Major module status (2 points).
- Taking shortcuts or implementing trivial features will result in rejection.
- Be creative and think outside the box.
- The module should be relevant to your project context.

**Minor**: Same as the major module but smaller in scope and less complex.
- Must still demonstrate technical skill and creativity.
- Should add meaningful value to your project.
- Requires justification in README.md (similar to Major, but for 1 point).

[◦ List of all chosen modules (Major and Minor).
◦ Point calculation (Major = 2pts, Minor = 1pt).
